=head1 INSTALLATION GUIDE

=head2 GET YABACKUP SOURCES

You can retrieve the sources of I<yaBackup> using one of the following method: 

=over

=item * Grab the current (potentially brocken) version of I<yaBackup>

In this case, proceed as follows: 

=over 

=item *

either go to the I<yaBackup> homepage at L<http://github.com/Falkor/yabackup>, 
click on the 'Download Source' button on top to get a tar archive named
C<Falkor-yabackup-xxxxxxx.tar.gz> then run:  

           cd
           tar xvzf /path/to/Falkor-yabackup-xxxxxxx.tar.gz
           cd yabackup

=item *

retrieve the latest version using git by running: 

           git clone git://github.com/Falkor/yabackup.git
           cd yabackup

=back

=item * Grab the latest stable realease (version 1.0)

(Details incoming)

=head2 AUTOTOOLS SETUP

I<yaBackup> rely on the Autotools to simplify its installation (i.e. via the
classical C<./configure; make; make install> procedure).

If the C<configure> is absent (i.e. if you grab the latest version of
I<yaBackup> from the GIT repository), or if for some reason you modify any
configuration file of the autotools (i.e. C<configure.ac> or C<Makefile.am>), 
you have to run: 

         ./bootstrap

This script assumes the availability on your system of the following software: 

=over 

=item 1. 

C<autoconf> version 2.6 or later

=item 2. 

C<automake> version 1.9.6 or later

=back

=head2 PERL CPAN MODULES

As I didn't want to reinvent the wheel, I<yaBackup> depends on the Perl modules
printed by running 

        ./bootstrap --extract-perl-modules

Their availability on your system will be checked by the C<configure> script of
course. If a module C<Module::Name> is missing, the best approach to install it
is to rely on B<cpan> (see L<http://search.cpan.org>) by running in a terminal: 

        sudo cpan

accept the default configurations and once the cpan prompt appears, simply run
C<install Module::Name> 

=head2 INSTALLATION

You can now run the C<configure> script (see C<./configure --help> for
configuration options). 

I advice you to use B<stow> (see L<http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/> or
L<stow(8)>, a wonderful tool to activate/desactivate different versions of the
same program compiled by autotools. Once installed (C<apt-get install stow>
under Debian or C<sudo port install stow> on Mac OS X), configure the directory
that will host the program compiled and later installed by B<stow> as follows:

         sudo mkdir /usr/local/stow
         sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/stow

You'll then typically install I<yaBackup> as follows:  

         ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/stow/yabackup-1.0
         make 
         make install
         cd /usr/local/stow
         sudo stow yabackup-1.0

The advantage of this approach is that I<yaBackup> will be present on your
system in the default location (C</usr/local/bin/yabackup> is a symbolic link
toward C</usr/local/stow/yabackup-1.0/bin/yabackup>) yet you can easily
disable this version of I<yaBackup> (and activate another one) by running: 

         cd /usr/local/stow
         sudo stow -D yabackup-1.0

I<Note>: this will simply remove the link C</usr/local/bin/yabackup>.

=head1 USAGE

Once install, please refer to L<yabackup(1)> or run C<yabackup --help> for usage
details.
