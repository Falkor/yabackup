INSTALLATION GUIDE
  GET YABACKUP SOURCES
    You can retrieve the sources of *yaBackup* using one of the following
    method:

    *   Grab the current (potentially brocken) version of *yaBackup*

        In this case, proceed as follows:

        *   either go to the *yaBackup* homepage at
            <http://github.com/Falkor/yabackup>, click on the 'Download
            Source' button on top to get a tar archive named
            "Falkor-yabackup-xxxxxxx.tar.gz" then run:

                       cd
                       tar xvzf /path/to/Falkor-yabackup-xxxxxxx.tar.gz
                       cd yabackup

        *   retrieve the latest version using git by running:

                       git clone git://github.com/Falkor/yabackup.git
                       cd yabackup

    *   Grab the latest stable realease (version 1.0)

  AUTOTOOLS SETUP
    *yaBackup* rely on the Autotools to simplify its installation (i.e. via
    the classical "./configure; make; make install" procedure).

    If the "configure" is absent (i.e. if you grab the latest version of
    *yaBackup* from the GIT repository), or if for some reason you modify
    any configuration file of the autotools (i.e. "configure.ac" or
    "Makefile.am"), you have to run:

             ./bootstrap

    This script assumes the availability on your system of the following
    software:

    1.  "autoconf" version 2.6 or later

    2.  "automake" version 1.9.6 or later

  PERL CPAN MODULES
    As I didn't want to reinvent the wheel, *yaBackup* depends on the Perl
    modules printed by running

            ./bootstrap --extract-perl-modules

    Their availability on your system will be checked by the "configure"
    script of course. If a module "Module::Name" is missing, the best
    approach to install it is to rely on cpan (see <http://search.cpan.org>)
    by running in a terminal:

            sudo cpan

    accept the default configurations and once the cpan prompt appears,
    simply run "install Module::Name"

  INSTALLATION
    You can now run the "configure" script (see "./configure --help" for
    configuration options).

    I advice you to use stow (see <http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/> or
    stow(8), a wonderful tool to activate/desactivate different versions of
    the same program compiled by autotools. Once installed ("apt-get install
    stow" under Debian or "sudo port install stow" on Mac OS X), configure
    the directory that will host the program compiled and later installed by
    stow as follows:

             sudo mkdir /usr/local/stow
             sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/stow

    You'll then typically install *yaBackup* as follows:

             ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/stow/yabackup-1.0
             make 
             make install
             cd /usr/local/stow
             sudo stow yabackup-1.0

    The advantage of this approach is that *yaBackup* will be present on
    your system in the default location ("/usr/local/bin/yabackup" is a
    symbolic link toward "/usr/local/stow/yabackup-1.0/bin/yabackup") yet
    you can easily disable this version of *yaBackup* (and activate another
    one) by running:

             cd /usr/local/stow
             sudo stow -D yabackup-1.0

    *Note*: this will simply remove the link "/usr/local/bin/yabackup".

USAGE
    Once install, please refer to yabackup(1) or run "yabackup --help" for
    usage details.
